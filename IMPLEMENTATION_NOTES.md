/**
 * DELETE FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
 * 
 * This document summarizes all the changes made to implement 
 * ownership-based delete functionality for posts and topics.
 * 
 * =============================================================
 * WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED
 * =============================================================
 * 
 * 1. DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATES
 *    - Added userId field to Topic model
 *    - Added User relation to Topic model
 *    - Reset database to apply schema changes
 * 
 * 2. SERVER ACTIONS
 *    - Created deletePost.ts - Deletes posts with ownership check
 *    - Created deleteTopic.ts - Deletes topics with ownership check
 *    - Updated createTopic.ts - Stores userId when creating topics
 * 
 * 3. UI COMPONENTS
 *    - Created PostDeleteButton.tsx - Delete button for posts
 *    - Created TopicDeleteButton.tsx - Delete button for topics
 *    - Updated PostList.tsx - Shows delete button to post owners
 *    - Updated TrendingTopics.tsx - Shows delete button to topic owners
 * 
 * 4. QUERY FUNCTIONS
 *    - Updated topics.ts - Added comprehensive query functions
 *    - Added proper TypeScript types
 *    - Added detailed function documentation
 * 
 * =============================================================
 * SECURITY FEATURES
 * =============================================================
 * 
 * 1. AUTHENTICATION CHECKS
 *    - All delete actions require user to be signed in
 *    - Session validation on every delete attempt
 * 
 * 2. OWNERSHIP VERIFICATION
 *    - Client-side: Delete buttons only show to owners
 *    - Server-side: Double-check ownership before deletion
 *    - Database-level: User relations enforce data integrity
 * 
 * 3. CONFIRMATION DIALOGS
 *    - Post deletion: Simple confirmation with title
 *    - Topic deletion: Strong warning about cascade effects
 *    - Double confirmation for topics (very destructive)
 * 
 * 4. CASCADE DELETES
 *    - Deleting topic removes all posts and comments
 *    - Deleting post removes all comments on that post
 *    - Proper order of operations to handle foreign keys
 * 
 * =============================================================
 * USER EXPERIENCE FEATURES
 * =============================================================
 * 
 * 1. VISUAL FEEDBACK
 *    - Loading states during deletion ("Deleting...")
 *    - Proper error messages for failed deletions
 *    - Success redirects to appropriate pages
 * 
 * 2. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
 *    - Delete buttons styled consistently
 *    - Proper spacing and hover effects
 *    - Mobile-friendly button sizing
 * 
 * 3. ACCESSIBILITY
 *    - Proper button labeling
 *    - Clear confirmation messages
 *    - Keyboard navigation support
 * 
 * =============================================================

 * 
 * FOR DEVELOPERS:
